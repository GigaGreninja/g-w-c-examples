    <p>Let me guess, you probably ended up here in a site that doesn't fit your expectations. I mean, that's alright, I
      am still learning after all.</p>

    <h3>Yousoro (You pronounced Yō) - an expression used by Yō Watanabe, the second member of the reformed Aqours group
      from Love Live Sunshine. It's actually a Nautical command that is used when the ship's course needs to be
      straightened but in the show's english subs, it's translated as "aye,aye". It is also a pun on the diver's name
      :). </h3>

    <p>Hello, hello, everyone! The name's Malavika but that's kinda a mouthful so feel free to call me Mal, Tsuki or
      even (hehe) the Shadow Gate! Yours truly is a junior with a focus level that rivals that of toddlers. I'm
      incredibly immature but I can be quite serious when I need to. I like drawing, listening to music, programming, watching anime (and simping for characters and their voice actors), and talking to myself or inanimate objects. I trust you there are weirder things than that. I also like to think I have a great sense of style, but that's just me.
